title:  "Sourdough Crumpets"
image: crumpets.jpg
tags: sourdough

time:
- PREP: 3 mins
- BAKE: 8 mins
- TOTAL: 11 mins

ingredients:
- 1 cup (227g) sourdough starter, unfed/discard
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3/8 teaspoon baking soda*
*If your discard starter is particularly sour, increase the baking soda to 1/2 teaspoon.


directions:
- Place the starter in a medium-sized bowl. Stir in the sugar and salt, then the baking soda. The batter should rise up and bubble a bit, becoming almost billowy.
- Heat your griddle over medium-low heat; 300Â°F is perfect. Lightly grease the surface with cooking oil (if your pan isn't non-stick), then melt a pat of butter atop the oil.
- Lightly grease four English muffin rings (1" high and 4" across) and place on the griddle. Divide the batter evenly among the rings. Each ring will take a generous 1/4 cup of batter; a generously heaped muffin scoop is the perfect tool for this task. Cook for about 5 minutes, until the tops are set and full of small holes. Carefully flip the crumpets over, remove the rings (they should pop right off), and continue to cook for about 3 minutes, until they're golden on the bottom. 
- Enjoy the crumpets warm, split and spread with butter and jam. Or toast to brown and crisp them before serving.
- Store any leftovers at room temperature for several days. Freeze, well wrapped, for longer storage.
